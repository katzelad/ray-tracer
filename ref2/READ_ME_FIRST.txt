This is a batch of simple scenes which demonstrate how the different
primitive objects are rendered with and without textures.

Please notice that the place and orientation of the texture
is highly dependant of the parametrization you implemented.

It is OK if in yout images the textures are positioned
differently than how they are positioned in these examples.
